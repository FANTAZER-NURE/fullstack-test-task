# Fullstack Movies App (Monorepo)

- Monorepo using npm workspaces: `frontend/` and `backend/`.
- See `docs/idea.md` and `docs/vision.md` for scope and architecture.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – runs backend in dev (see backend package).
- `npm run build` – builds backend then frontend.
- `npm start` – starts backend (built output).

Deploy each app from its subdirectory (Render/Netlify supported).
